# Baseball
I have played baseball since I was 7 years old and loved every minute of it. As I go to college I want  
to be able to play baseball whether that is playing on the club team or any REC team that I can find I  
just want to be able to play. While at **Chamois** the school got a team my last two years of highschool  
While playing on the team everyone recongnized my as the best player and I was the team captain both  
years. During my senior year I was considered the best player in the league that we played in.
